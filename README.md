This web app is for a fictional restaurant called Little Lemon is built using React. The application's main feature is creating a homepage displaying information to the customer about Little Lemon and allowing them to reserve a table using the website. To ensure a friendly user experience, validation is included for each input field. Once a date and time are reserved, the user can no longer reserve the exact date and time. There is a default "Under Construction" page for currently not implemented features that will notify the user and give them options to redirect themselves to the website.
